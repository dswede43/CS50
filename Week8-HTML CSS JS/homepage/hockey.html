            <h2><b>Minor league</b></h2>
            <p>
                Growing up, I played competitive hockey in the greater Toronto area finishing my last year of
                minor hockey as a defensemen with the Midget AAA Mississauga Rebels.
                We won the COGECO Golden Horseshoe tournament and finished 2nd place for the 2015-2016 Greater
                Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) regular season losing in the final round of playoffs.

            <h2><b>Sweden</b></h2>
            <p>
                I played one season of hockey for <a href="https://www.almtuna.com/">Almtuna IS</a> in Uppsala, Sweden when I was 13 years old living with my uncle away from my parents.
                I enjoyed playing European style hockey, went to a Swedish elementary school and made friendships in Sweden I still keep today.

            <h2><b>High school</b></h2>
            <p>
                In my senior year of high school hockey, our team (the R.H. King Lions) won the Toronto District Secondary Schools Athletic Association (TDSSAA) regional championships in the Scarborough area.
                I also played for the school field lacrosse team as a long pole, where we lost in the regional finals for our conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my efforts in high school hockey and lacrosse, I was awarded the R.H. King Academy Athletic Award in my last year of high school in 2016.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Junior league</b></h2>
            <p>
                Upon starting my post-secondary studies at the University of Ottawa, I played junior B hockey in the Ottawa area for the <a href="https://owgk.ca">Ottawa West Golden Knights</a>.
                In my rookie year, we finished first in the Tier 2 Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL2) with a record of 46-6.
                The most memorable part of that year was our 3-0 comeback in the first round of playoffs winning in game 7. Unfortunately, we lost the next round of playoffs üôÅ
            </p>
            <p>
                In my final year, I was named captain and won first team all-star for the entire league as a defensemen in the CCHL2 2018-2019 season.

                Today, I enjoy playing casual hockey among friends with the occasional pond hockey game üôÇ
